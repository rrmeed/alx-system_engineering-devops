- Your Puppet manifests must run without error
- Your Puppet manifests first line must be a comment explaining what the Puppet manifest is about
- Your Puppet manifests files must end with the extension `.pp`

# **Note on Versioning**

Your Ubuntu 20.04 VM should have Puppet 5.5 preinstalled.

# **Install `puppet`**

```
$ apt-get install -y ruby=1:2.7+1 --allow-downgrades
$ apt-get install -y ruby-augeas
$ apt-get install -y ruby-shadow
$ apt-get install -y puppet

You do **not** need to attempt to upgrade versions. This project is simply a set of tasks to familiarize you with the basic level syntax which is virtually identical in newer versions of Puppet.
